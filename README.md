# deep_learning_orbital-regression-project
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between orbital positions and time through polynomial regression using a neural network implemented in Keras. By leveraging a dataset containing time and corresponding orbital position data, we aim to develop a model that accurately predicts orbital positions based on time inputs.
